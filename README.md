<h3 align="center">Windows 11 Custom Setup</h3>

<p align="center">
My personal Windows 11 setup — tuned for a minimal, productive workflow with a clean, consistent look.  
Built around GlazeWM, YASB, and a few small tweaks that make the system feel smoother.  
Big shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/SleepyCatHey">SleepyCatHey</a> for sparking the idea.

# Overview

## 📏 YASB


YASB (Yet Another Status Bar) is a customizable status bar for Windows written in Python. I use it to show system stats, media info, and some custom widgets.

**⚙️ Setup**
- Download and install [**YASB**](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb)
- Copy the files from my config folder (styles.css and config.yaml)
- Restart YASB

## 🪟 GlazeWM + YASB

> [!NOTE]  
> My setup uses GlazeWM with YASB. 

GlazeWM is a tiling window manager for Windows — it keeps windows organized and keyboard-friendly. I use it together with YASB for a seamless layout and bar integration.

**⚙️ Setup**
- Install [**GlazeWM**](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)
- Replace the default config with mine  
- Restart GlazeWM and fine-tune keybindings if needed

## 🦅 Windhawk

Windhawk is a mod manager for Windows that lets you tweak system elements without heavy tools. I use it for subtle UI adjustments — mainly the taskbar and system tray.

> [!NOTE]  
> My taskbar mod hides the Start menu and network icon by default.  
> If you prefer to keep them visible, check out  
> [this guide](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windows-11-taskbar-styling-guide).

## 👾 Windows Power Toys

PowerToys is a collection of Microsoft utilities for power users.
I mainly use it for PowerToys Run — its Spotlight-style search and command palette that makes launching apps, running commands, and finding files way quicker than the default Windows search.

**⚙️ Setup**
- Install [**Power Toys**](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.95.1)
- Activate the Tools you like.

## 🎨 Browser Stylus

I myself like to use Firefox based browsers like Zen.
To have the Catppuccin Mocha design there use this addon to overwrite CSS files for hundrets of pre made sites.

**⚙️ Setup**
- Install [**Stylus**](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
- Download the [**Catppuccin Port**](https://userstyles.catppuccin.com/getting-started/usage/)
- Import all the userstyles into Stylus
